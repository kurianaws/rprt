In the paper \cite{violajones} Viola et al. proposes an algorithm to speed up face recognition. Face recognition, involves finding difference in
pixel intensities between rectangular blocks of pixels. what viola jones algorithm does is to create an intermediate image called
the integral image which is easier to operate on. The integral image significantly speeds up face recognition techniques. It does
this by reducing the number of times a value is accessed from the disk to calculate an image feature.
