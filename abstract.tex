This project is an implementation of Opencv in real world. It uses, Raspberrypi for easy replication and portability. The module, works
by capturing images of objects, temporarily storing them on disk and processing them to see if image of a face exists in
the stored image. After detection stored images is immediately deleted or over written to conserve space. 

From opencv we use feature extraction a feature extraction method, which subtracts pixels of a group(identified by the algorithm) from
the original image, to form a pattern object. This pattern object is then subjected to neural network to check if it fits the pattern of a face.
