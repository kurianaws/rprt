\section{Litratrue Survey}
In the paper \cite{opencv} W.Sriratana et al. presents a face identification system. It works by capturing image in real time, converting that image to integral image,
and running FAARfunction on it. The FAAR function searches for standard facial features like dark regions around eyes, light regions at the nose. The output of Faar function
is a set of FAAR features. This output is then input to a neural network, which identifies the face.
