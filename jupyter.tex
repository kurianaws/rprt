\section{Jupyter Notebook}
Jupyter Notebook is an interactive python editor, and interperter, that works on a web page. It is hosted by sites like github, googlecollab, kaggle.
It provides an alternative to commandline text editors to the extent of using python as a programming language. It has the added advantage of graphical
visualization, like graphs, images, charts etc which are not available on a commandline. User will be able to easily see the result of code written
by them in the jupyter notebook IDE.


The Notebook addition to running code, stores code and output, together with markdown notes, in an editable document called a notebook. This is sent from browser to the notebook server, which saves it on disk as a JSON file with a .ipynb extension.
